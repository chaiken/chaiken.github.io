<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520278127"> The Big
Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream</a> by <a
href="https://www.steveviscelli.com/#!">Steve Viscelli</a> </div>

<p>As a child growing up in the 1960's, I thought of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a> as an
evil mafioso who stole from trucking companies and Teamster members
alike.  While that characterization contains some truth, one of the
contributions of Steve Viscelli's history is to bring to light Hoffa's
real contributions to the trucking industry, culminating with the
National Master Freight Agreement in 1964.   Viscelli explains how the
hub-and-spoke system mandated by the Agreement resulted in many
logistical inefficiencies, but also resulted in greater industry
stability, and guaranteed a living wage to truck drivers.   The myth
of the long-haul truck driver as a 'king of the road' with great
independence was born at that time, when it held some truth.   The
main point of Viscelli's sometimes dry acount is to explain how far
away from independence today's weakened truck drivers have fallen, and
how the industry came to be in the situation that we now find it.
Industry publications like the always informative <a
href="http://www.ttnews.com/">Transport Topics</a> expend considerable
ink on the state of the national truck driver shortage, but they never
explain <em>why</em> the shortage exists.
</p>

<p>Viscelli is a sociologist rather than an investigative reporter or
technology historian, so the text focuses mostly on Viscelli's 6-month
stint as a commercial over-the-road driver and findings from
interviews with drivers at truck stops.  Viscelli convincingly reveals
the swindle to which "independent owner-operators" of trucks have
fallen prey, as "debt peonage" is a more realistic description of
their state.  His account of the collusion between state regulators,
commercial drivers schools and trucking companies is disturbing to
read.  Far from 'kings of the road', today's long-haul drivers are
frequently underpaid, overworked and in continual financial peril.
While no one would wish for Hoffa's return, his tenure, like that of
Saddam Hussein, perhaps had some merits.
