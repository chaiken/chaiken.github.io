    <h2>
      For Presenters
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: How do you find potential speakers?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Some volunteer, and some we learn about through news media,
      conferences and conference proceedings, academic journals,
      social media, podcasts or acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can I or my colleague speak about XXX?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Is XXX related to automotive technology or intelligent
      transportation systems?   Or perhaps related to legal, policy or
      history of automotive technology or ITS?  And you're willing to
      speak in person for free, on a weeknight in the San Francisco
      Bay Area?  Note that facility tours or technology demos are
      even better than presentations.  See the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Automotive-Open-Source/events/past/">list of previous
      meetups</a> for some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What are qualifications for speakers?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Do you know more about an appropriate topic than the
      audience, and are you credibly able to produce an informative
      and entertaining talk?
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can I mention my company's product?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Certainly, as long as it's relevant to the talk topic and the
      presentation is not a flat-out sales pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: How long should a presentation be?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Our audiences ask a lot of questions, so usually about 40
      minutes is best, as the resulting presentation will be in total
      be about an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: I'd like to present, but don't want to take the whole hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Let us know and we can organize a split bill or a panel discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: I don't want to speak, but I'd like to display a demo.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Please do before the main speaker.   I recommend staging your
      demo near the refreshments for maximum exposure.  Show up early,
      as early attendees will then be all yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: I don't want to speak, but I'd like to make an announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Anyone is relevant to make an announcement at the start of
      each meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Who is the audience?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Automotive-Open-Source/members/">Members</a>
      need not explain themselves in order to participate, so we only
      know when people self-identify.  People who have done so may be
      working in the auto industry, working in other tech fields,
      entrepreneurs, retirees, venture capitalists, IP attorneys,
      regulators, individual software developers, faculty, students,
      unemployed or overseas visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What technical level is appropriate for the presentation?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It varies.  As long as the talk title and abstract are an
      accurate description of the presentation, attendees will
      self-select.  SVAOS draws decent audiences for business,
      technical and regulatory/cultural talks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What about a scooter, electric bike, smart skateboard, truck,
      bus, autonomous shopping cart . . . talk?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Certainly.  We once had
      a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Automotive-Open-Source/events/226186597/">successful
      event that featured smart wheelchairs</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      For Facility Hosts and Underwriters
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: How large a facility is needed?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: SVAOS has met everywhere from auditoriums to rooms seating
      50.  For facility tours, a capacity of 10 or 15 is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What should we plan to provide?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: A room with a projector and chairs.  Refreshments are
      suggested, as they increase attendance, and blank adhesive name
      badges are great if they're readily available.
    </p>
     <p>
      Q: Is it okay to present a little bit about our company or product?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's encouraged.  If hosts want to present for more than 10
      minutes, we should consider a separate event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Is it a problem that our facility can only admit attendees who
      preregister with full names, or attendees who show ID?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: It's fine as long as we add this requirement to the
      announcement before opening registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: We have no facility to offer, but we'd like to underwrite a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Corporate sponsors are welcome to underwrite refreshments at
      a meeting hosted by another entity, such as a student group,
      which has no funds for refreshments.
    </p>


    <h2>
      For Organizers of other events
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: Could we offer the event we've already planned as a joint
      meeting with SVAOS?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: As long as the event meets the other stated criteria
      (on-topic, in Bay Area, reasonably priced), it's fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can we announce our upcoming conference on the mailing list?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Any group member can post to the list.   Please keep
      announcements on-topic, as previously described, and limit to
      one per event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can we announce our upcoming conference at a meeting?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Please do.
    </p>


    <h2>
      For Everyone
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: What is the usual schedule for meetups?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Typically, doors at the venue open at 6 and light
      refreshments are on at 6:30. The formal meeting begins with a
      few minutes of announcements at 7.  We usually vacate the
      facility by 8:30.  These times are all flexible.  Indeed, we
      once held an event
      <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Automotive-Open-Source/events/224903728/">at
      a car dealership on a Saturday</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Why aren't there videos or live streams of the talks?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Because we need a volunteer to create and post them, and no
      one has come forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: You must be making a lot of money on these events!
    </p>
    <p>
      A: 100% of the door fees goes directly to student groups (except
      meetup.com and PayPal charges) usually
      the <a href="https://power.sjsu.edu/project/12942">Formula SAE
      Spartan Racing Team at San Jose State University</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Can members suggest or organize meetings?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Sure, as long as they're on topic (about automotive or
      intelligent transportation) and in the Bay Area and reasonably
      priced.
      Examples: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Automotive-Open-Source/events/254511684/">book
      discussion</a>, short course, happy hour, luncheon, lightning
      talks, picnic, hackathon, poster fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What is the Group's purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: <ul><li>To promote the adoption of positive engineering, regulatory, business and societal practices;</li>
	<li>To foster discussion and increase the transparency of the
	  automotive and broader transportation industry;</li>
	<li>To provide a resource for job-seekers, hiring managers,
	  entrepreneurs and students in the transportation space;</li>
	<li>To make the San Francisco Bay Area a center of excellence
	in this endeavor.</li></ul>
