How to get German and English keyboard layouts under Debian-KDE:

Enabling the German Keyboard

0. Run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales".

1. In KDE, go to System Settings . . . Input Devices.

2. Under Keyboard menu, pick Layouts tab.

3. Click on "Configure layouts" and then "Add."

4. Add German, click OK and then Apply.   A new icon will appear on the KDE toolbar.  Clicking this icon enables German language, but there is still no way to select German keys.

Using the Germany Keyboard

5.  Back at System Settings . . . Input Devices . . . Keyboard settings, choose the Advanced tab.  Expand the 'Key to choose 3rd level' item.

6. Select 'Any Win key'.   Don't you feel delighted to have a use for the Win keys?  Click Apply.

7. Now to type German characters, hold down a Win key while typing.   To type US characters, just type normally, or disable German characters altogether by right-clicking on the toolbar icon and selecting 'US'.
