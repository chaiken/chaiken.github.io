For all provided images:
user jack
pword jack
root pword jack

Fedora systemd version: 219
Debian systemd version: 224

Feel free to run the tests with any systemd that is most relevant to your
typical computing environment.

Be sure that the image files are owned by root.  Untarring the
provided images as a normal user may lead to weird errors after boot.

Before class, I recommend everyone to install the Graphviz package

-- Recommendations for users of recent Linux versions --
Try the Debian or Fedora systemd-nspawn containers (provided).
BEFORE CLASS: check that your version of systemd supports systemd-nspawn.

Container images:
http://she-devel.com/LISA15/debianTestingcontainer.tar.xz
http://she-devel.com/LISA15/f22container.tar.xz

Advantage: the containers method is the fastest for testing.
Disadvantage: won't work with older versions of systemd or with SysVinit-only systems.

Files: debianTestingcontainer.tar.xz, f22container.tar.xz

-- Recommendations for users of older Linux versions --
Run the Debian or Fedora Qemu .raw images (provided).
BEFORE CLASS:  please install qemu, qemu-kvm, qemu-utils and qemu-system-x86.
You may also need to turn on virtualization extensions in your bios.

Advantage: should work on any Linux system from the last several years with SysVinit.
Disadvantage: slower, takes more disk space.

Files: debian-testing.raw.gz, fedora-22.raw.gz
Available from USB stick only.

These images will work on any system that runs Qemu.

-- Recommendations for Windows and MacOS users --
Run VMplayer with the provided Debian or Fedora VMX files.
BEFORE CLASS: please install VMplayer.

Advantage: cross-platform.
Disadvantage: I haven't much tested it.   Takes more disk space than containers, less than Qemu.

Files: debian-testing-VMware.tar.xz, fedora22-VMWare.tar.xz
Available from USB stick only.

These images will work on any system that runs VMplayer.

-- Or, if you have a network connection,
login into a remote host running systemd natively that you don't mind rebooting.

-- Or, simply run the examples on your laptop, keeping in mind that you will hvae to reboot several times.

How to run the containers:
-----------------------------------
sudo tar xJf {debianTesting.tar.xz, f22container.tar.xz}
Get console:
sudo systemd-nspawn -D <path to top-level directory of untarred files>
'Boot' the container:
sudo systemd-nspawn -bD <path to top-level directory of untarred files>
Info: man systemd-nspawn

How to run the Qemu images:
-----------------------------------
gunzip the image of your choice as root.

run_Fedora_Qemu.sh:
#!/bin/bash
ROOTDIR=<your TLD>
HDNAME=fedora-22
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -name ${HDNAME} -boot c -drive file=${ROOTDIR}/${HDNAME}.raw,format=raw -m 4096 -smp cpus=1 -net nic,model=e1000  -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:6666-:22 -vga std -localtime

run_Debian_Qemu.sh:
#!/bin/bash
ROOTDIR=<your TLD>
HDNAME=debian-testing
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -name ${HDNAME} -boot c -drive file=${ROOTDIR}/${HDNAME}.raw,format=raw -m 4096 -smp cpus=1 -net nic,model=e1000  -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:6666-:22 -vga std -localtime

How to run the VMware images
--------------------------------------

Untar the provided image of your choice as root.

Start VMplayer from a shell.

From the GUI, choose "Open a Virtual Machine."

Navigate to the top-level directory and select the .vmx file.

On Linux, if you get an error message that vmmon and vmci are not found, then
try

sudo modprobe vmw_vmci; sudo modprobe vmmon

then try again.
