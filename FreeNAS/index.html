<p><em>Goal</em>: robust, secure backup of both desktop and laptop computers at home</p>

<h3><em>Hardware</em>:</h3> 
<p>
<a href="http://ixsystems.com/freenas-mini">iX Systems FreeNAS
	  Mini</a> with four WDC WD20EFRX discs arranged in a four-disk RAID-Z
	  ZFS pools.  Half of the space is for backup, and half is for
	  a future <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a>
	  installation.  Disapointingly, the system arrived <a
	  href="https://bugs.freenas.org/issues/9938">improperly
	  cabled</a>, but once that minor problem was fixed, I've
	  found it to be a truly nice piece of equipment.  Thanks to
	  marbus90 and webdestroya for help in figuring this out.  The
	  Mini has a lot of storage in a small space, runs cool, and
	  is reasonably quiet.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p><em>Why FreeNAS Mini?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>FreeNAS is a downstream distribution of FreeBSD, and the BSDs
appear to have better security than Linux.</li>

<li>Because it's quite simple to set-up FreeBSD "jails" on the FreeNAS
host, FreeNAS actually has a lot of applications.</li>

<li>FreeNAS, like FreeBSD, is open source.</li>

<li>FreeNAS, like FreeBSD, has ongoing support and frequent
updates.</li>

<li>FreeNAS and FreeBSD have outstanding documentation, including even
<a href="http://www.freenas.org/freenas-zfs-training">classes taught
by Linda Kateley</a>, and a helpful IRC channel at freenode.</li>

</ul>


<p><em>Why <a href="http://bacula.org/">Bacula</a>?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bacula will push backups to remote via TCP and SSL rather than being
           limited to NFS-mounted remotes like LuckyBackup and
	   Duplicati.</li>

<li>Bacula is a truly distributed and modular backup system, which allows the
various daemons to all run on different hosts.</li>

<li>There are Bacula clients for both FreeBSD and Linux.</li>

<li>Bacula is open-source.</li>

<li>Bacula has outstanding documentation and a helpful IRC channel
	   at freenode.</li>

<li>Bacula is fully automated, and is much faster than a tar+rsync solution, particularly for
finding particular files in existing backups.   See the <a href="#restore">'restore'
example below</a>.</li>

</ul>


<p><em>Why <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a>?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Because Debian.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What about cloud storage?</em><br />
I also have my bits backed up at <a
href="http://strongspace.com">Strongspace.com</a>, which:
</p>

<ul>
<li>has an <a href="git://github.com/expandrive/strongspace-ruby.git">open source</a> Ruby CLI interface</li>
<li>supports transfer of ZFS snapshots</li>
<li>supports rsync transfer.</li>
<li>TODO: implement automatic 'zfs send snapshot' from the FreeNAS host to Strongspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>	On the FreeNAS box that has ip address 10.0.0.8, the bacula-sd
	Storage Daemon is running inside a FreeBSD jail.  The jail has
	a user bacula and its own ip address, 10.0.0.6.   The FreeNAS
	box itself has a user bootstrapbackup who receives copies of the
	Bacula bootstrap files via a 'RunScript' that may be found in
	the <a href="bacula-dir.conf">bacula-dir.conf</a> file.  A
	FreeNAS shell is available via SSH from the desktop.

'bootstrap' files that are scp'ed over from the desktop by the Bacula
Director via a 'RunScript' defined in <a
href="bacula-dir.conf">bacula-dir.conf</a>.   Note that FreeNAS
doesn't know about the 'bacula' user, who has an account in the
'Backup' FreeBSD jail, not in the FreeNAS system.</em></p> </div>

<p><em>One of the cool features of FreeNAS is the ability to attach to
the console of jails from the web interface. The output shows that the
Bacula Storage Daemon process is running as user bacula by reading the
/usr/local/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf configuration file.  The bacula
user account was created by via the 'adduser' command typed at this
shell.</em></p> 

<p>As Jens Heinrich helpfully pointed out via email, it's also
possible to access the by ssh'ing to the FreeNAS host, running 'jls'
to list the jails, and 'jexec &lt;jail-number&gt; /bin/sh'.   'jexec' is
clearly FreeBSD's equivalent to Linux's 'chroot'.

shells.   The shell available from the left menu duplicates the one

shell, which is easily confused with the jails'.
</em></p>
</div>

<h2><em>How</em></h2>

<p>	I ended up compiling Bacula from source on both FreeBSD and
	Debian because that was the simplest way to install compatible
	recent versions.  The Bacula project does *not* employ
	<a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>, and in fact versions 7.0.x and 7.2.x are
	not compatible.    Therefore the Storage Daemon on the NAS
	and the other Daemons on the desktop and laptop are all version
	7.2.1 from bacula git.
</p>

<p>
<em>How to tell if bacula-sd and bacula-dir are incompatible versions</em>:<br/>

        The Storage Daemon and Director must be the same 
        version.   If  the Director  is compiled from a more recent
        release, it will successfully contact
        the SD via the bconsole application, but the handshaking around volume creation
	will fail.    A 'label' command will get an encouraging response from the
	SD:
</p>

<pre>	
	3000 OK label. VolBytes=193 VolABytes=0 VolType=1 Volume="Volume0" Device="BonnetFileStorage3" (/bonnet)
</pre>

<p>     but the Director will report</p>
<pre>
	Label command failed for Volume Volume0.
	Do not forget to mount the drive!!!
</pre>

<p>     The reason is that the string returned by the SD is not in the format
	that the Director expects.
</p>


<p><em>How to Compile and Install the Bacula Storage Daemon on FreeNAS</em>:<br/>

	First I installed the <a href="
	https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">FreeBSD
	Ports tree</a> inside my FreeBSD jail using the jail's console
	that is available via the FreeNAS web interface.  Then I
	compiled and installed the bacula-server port that <a href="
	http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/sysutils/bacula-server/">I
	obtained from freebsd.org</a>.

	Thanks to m0nkey at #freenas on Freenode IRC for suggesting
	this approach!

	I used standard CLI tools to create a bacula user and group
	*inside the jail* and set bacula user as owner of the
	directory that constitutes the Bacula Storage Daemon's Pool.

	Inside the jail, the Bacula <a href="bacula-sd.conf">Storage
	Daemon's config file</a> is kept at

	/usr/local/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf

	bacula-sd is restarted when the jail is restarted when the
	jail is restarted because I added the following lines to <a
	href="/etc/rc.conf.local">rc.conf.local</a> file that is
	within the jail:
</p>

<pre>
	bacula_sd_enable="YES"
	bacula_sd_flags=" -u bacula -g bacula -v -c /usr/local/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf"
</pre>




<p><em>Compiling on Debian</em>:</p>

<pre>
	git clone http://git.bacula.org/bacula
	git checkout -b Branch-7.2 origin/Branch-7.2
	cd bacula/bacula
	./<a href="config-me">config-me</a>
	make; sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
Also attached is a <a href="install_logwatch_files_Debian">shell
script</a> that set ups inclusion of Bacula status summaries in the
desktop Director-hosting system's syslog for Debian.  The upstream
version that comes from Bacula's git repo only works for RedHat-like
distributions.   Use the script from the bacula/bacula directory.
</p>

<p>On Jessie, using systemd, set the bacula-dir and bacula-fd daemons
to start at boot via
</p>

<pre>
	systemctl enable bacula-fd
	systemctl enable bacula-dir
	systemctl start bacula-fd
	systemctl start bacula-dir
</pre>


<p><em>Configuring the Bacula Director and File Daemon</em><br/>

Much of the Bacula documentation expects that the backups will go to
tape, and figuring out how to tune the configuration for disk backup
can be puzzling.  Happily there's some <a
href="http://blog.bacula.org/whitepapers/CommunityDiskBackup.pdf">guide
especially for disk backups</a>.
</p>
<p>
Attached are the finale configuration files I ended up with for the
Bacula <a href="bacula-dir.conf">Director</a>, <a
href="bacula-fd.conf_bonnet">File Daemon on desktop</a>, <a
href="bacula-fd.conf_hildesheim">File Daemon on laptop</a>, <a
href="bconsole.conf">Console</a> and <a href="bat.conf">bat</a>.
The point that confused me the most was the presence of the 'Pool' and
'FileSet' properties in the 'Restore' job of the autogenerated
bacula-dir.conf files.  These properties have no effect, and should be
ignored.  Note that there are two File Daemon configuration files, one
for each 'Client' and only one file of the other types, corresponding
to just one daemon instance.   Immense thanks to optiz0r, dvl and
mntbkr for all their advice about the setup.

<p><em>The Bacula 'bat' GUI dashboard displaying the Volumes in the

featureful and easy to use, but suffers from the shortcoming that it
must be run as root: not with 'sudo', but with root login.   The
reason is that bat must be able to read the .conf files that are
stored in the Bacula installation directory whose default permissions
are 700.</p>

<h3><em><a name="singlerestore">Restoring Single Files</a></em>:</h3> 

<p>One of the most compelling features of Bacula is that it
efficiently stores data in logical volumes, including packing multiple
backups into a single volume, and yet it allows fast retrieval of
individual files.  The desired file may be specified by name, in which
case the 'restore' command will display all paths from all the
matching backups that contain a matching filename.  Should a file with the
same complete path appear in multiple volumes, then the interface
offers all the versions, implementing, in effect, a poor-man's version
of version-control.
</p>

<p><em>The bconsole CLI processing a 'restore' command for a file
named cscope.out.  All paths from all volumes with matching filenames
are offered.</em></p>
</div>

<h3><em><a name="bulkrestore">Restoring a Failed Disk</a></em>:</h3>

<p>Restoring gigabytes of files from a failed or failing disk requires a bit more thought.    For example, restoring a partition that's no longer present to its original pathname would require changes to /etc/fstab to mount that partition on a different UUID, which is inconvenient when the system is borked.   Instead, restore to a different partition name on a new disk, then rename that partition if everything looks okay.   The figure shows how I restored the files in /home/alison to /home2/alison on the new disk.   Bacula automagically located all the volumes which held the newest versions of files in that directory.

<p><em>'strip_prefix' and 'add_prefix' allow an Admin to cleanly restore files to a new disk.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The files to be restored must now be selected from the list of candidates that the previous step created using the 'markdir' and 'mark' commands.
