A review of<br/> of <a
 href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/200785/ingenious-by-jason-fagone">Ingenious:
 a True Story of Automotive Daring, and the Race to Revive America</a>
 by <a href="http://www.jasonfagone.com/ingenious/">Jason Fagone</a>
 </div>

<p>Fagone's <em>Ingenious</em> is downright heart-warming and
inspiring, and not in an icky, Disney way.  In a conventional sense,
there's no happy ending, in that none of the real-life protagonists
become rich or famous.  Instead their stories illustrate the
bottom-line truth of engineering careers: that a job well-done on a
technology about which the implementor cares deeply is truly its own
reward.
</p>

<p>Fagone's carefully researched and readable book follows several
teams that competed in the Automotive X Prize competition that kicked
off with the X Prize Foundation's announcement of rules in 2007, but
didn't have its denouement until the awarding of the Prize in 2012.
The Foundation's  stated goal was to foster development of a
commercially plausible vehicle capable of 100 MPGe.  Judged by those
criteria, the competition was abundantly successful.</p>

<p>Fagone recounts in detail the saga of three teams: Illuminati
Autoworks, from a small-town in Illinois; Edison2 from Richmond, VA;
and a high school team from West Philadelphia, PA.  Fagone sketches
the travails of other competitors like odds-on favorite Aptera, but
his heart is with the small-timer underdogs whose resolve and passion
are remarkable.  Each of the three projects has colorful characters at
the helm.  Illuminati is led by Kevin Smith, a brilliant underachiever
who recognizes himself as such.  The captain of Edison2 is Oliver
Kuttner, a maverick German entrepreneur who makes decisions
impulsively and by instinct, and who is willing to outwork any
competitor to succeed.  The inspiring teacher behind the West Philly
team is Simon Hauger, who produces remarkable results on a challenging
project despite the lack of relevant expertise of all the
contributors.
</p>

<p><em>Ingenious</em> is a surprisingly decent technical read,
especially given that its author is a newspaper sports reporter.  The
description of the aerodynamic challenges of designing an ultra-high
fuel economy car are particularly well described.  In addition, Fagone
makes no secret of his belief that the Automotive X Prize was
particularly poorly managed, and that the organizers truly tortured
contestants by continually changing the rules of the competition.
While participation in the troubled contest has not brought
worldly success to any of the teams, Fagone convincingly makes the
case that the teams he covers in detail were all winners.

<p>Much thanks to <a

Durney</a> for alerting me to the existence of this fine book, to <a
href="http://www.robocars.com">Brad Templeton</a> for making me aware of
the Automotive X Prize in the first place, and to Mark Finnern for
running the <a href="http://futuresalon.org">Future Salon</a> where I
heard Brad speak.</p>
