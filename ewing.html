<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/books/review/volkswagen-scandal-faster-higher-farther-jack-ewing.html">Faster,
Higher, Farther</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">Jack Ewing of the New York Times</a>
</div>

<p>I've followed the auto industry pretty closely for the past 6 years
and even worked some on a Volkswagen project, but I was still shocked by
this book.  Ewing makes a compelling case that Volkswagen's recent
shenanigans are part of a long pattern of deception, and that no one
should have expected anything different given the Porsche-Pi&#235;ch family's
domination of the company throughout its existence.  The contrast with
the <a href="mulally.html">Ford family's stewardship of their
namesake company</a> could not be starker.
</p>

<p>Ewing's account feels a bit premature, given that new revelations
about the illegal behavior of VW, its contractor Bosch and its
frenemies at Daimler and BMW continue to appear.  Nonetheless, Ewing's
account of the patient and persistent efforts of U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency employees in Los Angeles and graduate students in
West Virginia to pry information out of VW makes for a surprisingly
readable narrative.  The epic tale of the power struggles within the
Pi&#235;ch-Porsche family is also a more colorful story than one might
expect.
</p>

<p>U.S. readers are bound to feel chagrin at the depth of the disdain
that V.W. and, especially, Audi management felt for U.S. autobuyers
and environmental regulators.  The unfortunate relationship of
environmental regulations to restraint of trade is made all too clear.
Ewing has clearly invested the time to interview all the parties
involved in the 'Abgasskandal', so his book is a must-read for anyone
interested in the recent history of the industry.
