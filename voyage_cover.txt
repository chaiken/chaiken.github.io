I'm pleased to apply for a job with Voyage since I was impressed by Oliver Cameron's Autonocast podcast interview.  In particular I'm enthusiastic about the Embedded Software Engineer, Platform opening due to my long-time interest in embedded Linux system monitoring tools, which are a foundation of system safety.  Presentations that I've given on this topic are linked at http://she-devel.com/.

Beyond real-time observability, I would welcome a chance to help integrate best-practice safety and coding standards into a continuous integration process.  Now is an exciting time in the system-safety field due to the recent issue of the SOTIF standard and the possibility of deploying new software tools associated with it.  While I would like to continue to write code every day, I'd enjoy helping to implement a testing pipeline stretching from unit tests, code coverage and static analysis all the way through simulation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, fuzzing and in-vehicle testing.  My personal Github (https://github.com/chaiken/Cpp-exercises/blob/master/README) relies
on the GoogleTest framework.

I follow news about safety and security of embedded systems, and am aware, for example, that AUTOSAR and MISRA have recently merged.  As part of my work at Peloton, I implemented the vehicle side of new cryptographically signed software image deployment with a chain of trust stretching all the way to the bootloader.  Without robust security, a truly safe vehicle system is clearly not obtainable.

I'd love to speak more with engineers at Voyage more about these topics.
