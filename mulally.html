A review of<br/>
<a href="http://www.brycehoffman.com/page1/index.html">American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford
Motor Company</a><br/> by Bryce G. Hoffman
 </div>

<p><em>American Icon</em> is largely the story of how Alan Mulally
teamed with Ford Chairman and family heir Bill Ford to save the
company from falling into bankruptcy during the devastating recession
that began in 2008.   The  company was powerfully motivated to
avoid financial disaster because the Ford family knew that inevitably
any reorganization would take away their controlling interest.  As a
consequence, the Ford Board of Directors got serious about financial and
management reform long before their equivalents at GM and Chrysler.
</p>

<p>Mulally himself certainly does deserve a lot of credit.   By being
resolutely positive and insisting on transparency and accountability
at all levels of the company, Mulally instituted a sea change in
Ford's management culture.   The author, who is a reporter for _The
Detroit News_, does criticize Mulally for a bit of personal greed, but
the portrait is largely positive.   All the adulation for Mulally
should not obfuscate the fact that Bill Ford was wise enough to step
aside as CEO and recruit the Boeing executive in the first place.
His portrait of Ford's recession-era pullback from the brink of
disaster makes a surprisingly gripping read.
</p>

<p>Hoffman's narrative is a bit poignant due to its publication in
2012.  He mentions the Company's improving quality and the hopeful
introduction of the new Sync computer interface and EcoBoost engines.
In fact, these innovations were disastrous for the automaker's
reliability ratings, as the <a
href="http://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA915411028.PDF">December
2013 <em>Consumer Reports</em></a> showed.  Hoffman mentions only that
Sync was "causing real problems for older motorists," where in fact <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/business/after-ratings-drop-ford-reworks-touch-screens.html">Sync
was widely panned by the automotive press.</a>   On the other hand,
given the then Head of North American Operations Mark Fields' early
cooperation with and support of Mulally, Fields' subsequent elevation
to the top position makes perfect sense.
