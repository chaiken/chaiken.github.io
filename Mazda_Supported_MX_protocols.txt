Figuring out Controller Area Network Protocols for 2005 Mazda 3

The 2005 Mazda 3 supports 3 communication protocols over the OBDII
Data Link Connector as identified using a Scantool.net OBDLink MX scantool and a
minicom connection.  [Note that Data Link Connector and Data Length
Code are both interpretations of "DLC" in this context, just as "CAN"
might refer to a variety of protocols.]   

1. Auto-protocol for OBDII
As printed by vehicle in response to "ATSP0;ATDPN":
A6 [AT]
As printed by vehicle in response to "ATSP0;STRPRS":
AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500) [AT]

2. High Speed CAN
HS CAN (ISO 11898, 11-bit Tx, 500kbps, var DLC)
As printed by vehicle in response to "STP31;STPRS":
HS CAN (ISO 11898, 500K/11B)

3. Medium Speed CAN
51 - MS CAN (ISO 11898, 11-bit Tx, 125kbps, var DLC)
As printed by vehicle in response to "STP51;STPRS":
MS CAN (ISO 11898, 125K/11B)

2005 Mazda 3 specifics
VIN JM1BK3437XXXXXXXX, 2005 Mazda3 with manual transmission, no turbo

3 protocols:

OBDLink MX's number 6 on standard OBDII pins 5, 6 and presumably 14
(signal common), talking 15765-4 "HS-CAN"
or "CAN" protocol at 500 kb/s with 29-bit identifiers.

MX's number 31 on pins 3, 11 and presumably 14, talking (Mazda's "MS-CAN") 11898  at 500 kb/s
with 11-bit identifiers and variable Data Length Code.   Might be
11898-2, which came out in 2003 and supports up to 1 MB/s.

MX's number 51 on pins 3, 11 and presumably 14 (same as protocol 31), talking 11898
(Mazda's "LS-CAN") at 125 kb/s with 11-bit identifiers and variable
Data Length Code.   11898-2 also, but at lower speed?    Slower
11898-3 didn't come out until 2006, although that doesn't mean
2006-model car couldn't already support it.

080-11 DRIVE MODE[LF, L3]
id0102a3801300
•	 Using the OBD-II drive mode, the monitoring item requested by OBD-II regulations can be easily diagnosed.
•	 Performing the Drive Mode inspects the OBD-II system for proper operation and must be performed to ensure
that no additional DTCs are present.
•	 The OBD-II drive mode is divided into the specific drive mode and single drive mode.
•	 For the specific drive mode, specified drive modes have been set for each individual monitoring item requested

by OBD-II regulations, and they can be diagnosed individually. For the single drive mode, the entire monitoring

item requested by OBD-II regulations can be diagnosed.

•	 The following modes are in the specific drive mode. The applicable system is diagnosed by driVing in the

following drive modes.

PCM (Powertrain Control Module) Adaptive Memory Produce Drive Mode

-
EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) System Repair Verification Drive Mode

- H02S heater, H02S, and TWC Repair Verification Drive Mode

-
EVAP System Repair Verification Drive Mode

•	 The following systems are diagnosed with the single drive mode.

EGR system

Oxygen sensor (H02S)

Oxygen sensor heater

Catalytic converter (TWC)

Fuel, misfire and evaporative (EVAP) system

Caution
•	 While performing the Drive Mode, always operate the vehicle in a safe and lawful manner.
•	 When the M-MDS is used to observe monitor system status while driving, be sure to have another
technician with you, or record the data in the M-MDS using the PID/DATA MONITOR AND RECORD
function and inspect later.
Note
•	 Vehicle speed and engine speed detected by the PCM may differ from that indicated by the speedometer
and tachometer. Use the M-MDS to monitor vehicle speed.
•	 If the OBD-II system inspection is not completed during the Drive Mode, the following causes are

considered:

- The aBO-II system detects the malfunction.

- The Drive Mode procedure is not completed correctly.

•	 Disconnecting the battery will reset the memory. Do not disconnect the battery during and after Drive
Mode.
•	 The M-MDS can be used at anytime through the course of the Drive Mode to monitor the completion
status. Monitoring can be done by viewing the ON BOARD SYSTEM READINESS menu.
•	 The aBO monitoring status can be confirmed with the ignition switch operation. During KOEO, the MIL
illuminates for a fall-light inspection for approx. 17 s. The aBO monitoring status is confirmed after the
fail-light inspection.
If all of the diagnosis is completed even one time, the MIL will continue to illuminate.
-
If all of the diagnosis is not completed, the MIL flashes for approx. 7 s, and then it illuminates until the
engine is started.
PCM Adaptive Memory Production Drive Mode
1.	 Start the engine and warm it up completely.
2.	 Verify the following conditions and correct if necessary:
•	 All accessory loads (AlC, headlights, blower fan, rear window defroster) are off.
3.	 Perform no load racing at the engine speed shown in the graph, then idle the engine for more than 60 s after

the cooling fan has stopped. If possible, monitor RPM PID for engine speed during this procedure.

numbers and associated fault conditions.

DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING TEST RESULTS[LF, L3]
id0102a3801400
The purpose of this test mode is to confirm the result of OBD-II
monitor diagnostic test results. The result values stored when
particular monitor is completed are displayed. If the monitor is not
completed, initial value is displayed.
 
Info on how to repair DTC-indicated problems continues to p. 609.

Tire-pressure monitoring, anti-lock brakes, and dynamic stability
control all can be watched through OBDII, but I don't have them
installed.
