A review of<br/>
<a href="http://www.freibergs.com/books/nanovation/">Nanovation: How a
Little Car Can Teach the World to Think Big and Act Bold</a><br/> by Kevin
and Jackie Freiberg and Dain Dunston
 </div>

<p><em>Nanovation</em> is two books that are interleaved but minimally
integrated.  One is a fairly compelling history of Rajan Tata's
attempt to launch the Nano as a low-priced, disruptive world car.  The
other is a turgid and cliched business text about how to motivate
employees under difficult circumstances.  The fact that the portion of
the book worth reading and the part that insults the intelligence are
in separate sections makes reading the history of the Nano project
easy: simply skip the blather at the end of each chapter.
</p>

<p>The pure automotive part of the book is not without its own flaws,
as the narrative fails to acknowledge the essential failure of the
Nano to achieve its wildly ambitious original goals.  Nonetheless, the
tales of how Rajan Tata came to aspire to build the Nano and how Ravi
Kant managed the development program are well worth reading.  The
story of Mamata Banerjee's successful effort to block the construction
of the first Nano factory at its planned Bengali site is certainly
instructive to Western audiences seeking to understand the business
environment in India.
</p>

<p>The automotive sections of the story abound with technical and
design details that are sure to fascinate any enthusiast.  Described
in full are Tata's failed attempts to make the Nano inexpensive but
not "cheap" in order to appeal to newly affluent middle class buyers.
Anyone particularly curious about the Indian automotive market should
definitely pick up a copy of <em>Nanovation</em>.
