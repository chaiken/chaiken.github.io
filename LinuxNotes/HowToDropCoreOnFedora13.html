<h1>How to restore core dumps on Fedora 13</h1>

<p>Prepared by <a href="mailto:alison@she-devel.com">Alison Chaiken</a>
and offered under <a href="

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Using tools
    like <a href="https://github.com/dneary/linux-devel-tools-tutorial/blob/master/Linux%20Devtools.odp">gdb
    to examine core files</a> can be extremely useful in debugging
    shaky programs on Linux.  (My other favorite tools besides gdb for
    diagnosing crashes are strace and ltrace, which I learned about
    from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Linux-Primer-Practical-Real-World/dp/0137017839/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Christopher
    Hallinan</a>.)  Frustratingly core files disappeared when abrtd
    appeared in <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, in
    release 12 if I recall correctly.  According
    to <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/">Dave Neary</a>, the
    traditional and simple "ulimit -c unlimited" is still all that's
    required to restore core files on Ubuntu, but Fedora expects more
    of their users.</p>

<h3>The source of the problem</h3>

<p>abrt <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ABRT">is a
Fedora system</a> which

<pre>
semi-automatically provides information about defects and crashes on
user system. It collects necessary data about the crash, generates a
report with all information and based on user interaction sends it to
some bug reporting system.
</pre>

The problem is, abrtd intercepts user-generated core files, even for
the programs the user writes him- or herself.  I have no problem with
abrtd catching Gnome or Firefox core files, but the fact that my
programs don't drop core in directories of my choice is simply
unacceptable.  Also, I find it very annoying that abrtd requires
creation of yet another new account with new credentials.  After all,
I'm already logged into localhost; why not offer me the choice of
sending my username and IP address?  Fundamentally, abrtd is simply
unacceptable to me, as much as I want to support Fedora debugging.
Out it goes.
</p>

<h3>The situation before steps below</h3>

<pre>
[alison@bonnet ~]$ ulimit -c unlimited
-bash: ulimit: core file size: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted
[alison@bonnet ~]$ sudo set ulimit -c unlimited
sudo: set: command not found
</pre>

<h3>Step-by-step restoration of core on Fedora 13</h3>

<ol>

<li>Get rid of that annoying abrtd:
<pre>
sudo service abrtd stop
</pre>
</li>

<li>Just go away abrtd and don't trouble me any more:
<pre>
sudo chkconfig --del abrtd
</pre>
</li>

<li>Edit /etc/sysctrl.conf and change
<pre>
kernel.core_pattern = |/usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp /var/spool/abrt %p %s %u %c
</pre>
to
<pre>
kernel.core_pattern = core
</pre>
</li>

<li>Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and add the line
<pre>
*  soft  core  unlimited
</pre>

(Yeah, "soft core".   Actually "hard core" is legal too.)
</li>

<li>Finally, edit /etc/init.d/functions if necessary:
<pre>
	# make sure it doesn't core dump anywhere unless requested
	corelimit="ulimit -S -c ${DAEMON_COREFILE_LIMIT:-0}"
</pre>
That step appears to be unnecessary.
</li>

<li>
<p>Now create a program that drops core.  (I assume that the reader
already knows how.)
</li>

</ol>

<h3>After steps above</h3>

<pre>
[alison@bonnet ~]$ ulimit -c unlimited
[alison@bonnet kernel_char]$ ./bit_palindrome
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>

<p>Finally!  A file called core.$PID will be dropped in $CWD.  Now the
user can "gdb $EXECUTABLE $CORE" to heart's content.</p>
