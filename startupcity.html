<a href="https://islandpress.org/books/start-city">Startup City:
Inspiring Private and Public Entrepreneurship, Getting Projects Done,
and Having Fun</a> by <a
href="http://www.gabeklein.com">Gabe Klein</a> and <a href="https://nacto.org/person/david-vega-barachowitz/">David Vega-Barachowitz</a></div>

<p>Klein and Vega-Barachowitz's lively book is perhaps a bit
too chatty and a bit lightweight compared to many dense tomes on
transportation planning.   Nonetheless, their accounts of recent
successes in improving urban mobility in Washington, DC and Chicago
are inspiring, as they lay out tips and relate lessons learned during
their struggles to get ambitious projects completed.   While the
authors clearly have a can-do spirit and a vision for the urban
transportation future, <em>Startup City</em>'s strongest point is the
large amount of practical advice it contains.  Many pages of
this brief volume are taken up by attractive if sometimes rather
uninformative illustrations, but Klen and Vega-Barachowitz also
present advice about how to inspire teams of workers who are used to
less engaged managers, and how to bring iterative, 'just-in-time'
planning techniques to the world of city government.  While I found
the title of the book rather crass at first, serial entrepreneur Klein
is perfectly sincere and obviously successful in his bringing the startup
world's risk-taking approach to urban planning.
</p>

<p>The upshot is that <em>Startup City</em> is something of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Warfare_(book)">guerrilla
tactics</a> manual for the coming urban transportation revolution.
Klein's record of ambitious accomplishments in both cities is a
testament to the fact that he really does know how to win, not via
factionalism and battling, but by attracting supporters.  The book
ends on a particularly hopeful note by citing the tremendous
opportunities that the urban mobility revolution offers for improving
lifestyles and land use.
