The tar archive includes 7 packages that were built on an Ubuntu 11.10
i386 system:

nobdy_1.0.0-10_i386.deb
nobdy-dev_1.0.0-10_i386.deb
genericobd2_1.0.0-6_i386.deb
libobd_1.0.0-5_i386.deb
libobd-dev_1.0.0-5_i386.deb
libqjson0_0.7.1+git20111204d_i386.deb
libqjson-dev_0.7.1+git20111204d_i386.deb

They require Qt 4.7 so, while they constitute less than
1 MB total, additional downloads to support them may require
considerable space if you do not already have the latest Qt installed.

The packages have only been tested on Ubuntu 11.10.  Please let me
know if you run them successfully on other Debian-derived
distributions.    Of course, please als

To install, first unpack the archive:

   tar xjf nobdy_debs_jan92012.tar.bz2

Install the packages using apt or dpkg:

   dpkg -i *.deb

You should now have a binary executable, /usr/bin/nobdy, and some configuration files in /etc/nobdy.   Learn how to run nobdy by reading the wiki:

Nobdy documentation: http://nobdy.wikia.com/wiki/Nobdy_Wiki
libobd documentation: http://libobd.wikia.com/wiki/Libobd_Wiki?cb=8608

Primary authors of these packages:

nobdy, genericobd2 -- tripzero
libobd -- mal2073
libqjson -- the upstream QJson team

Note: the QJson included with nobdy is a more recent version than the
one packaged with Ubuntu 11.10.  Based on reading the commit logs, I
believe that installing it is unlikely to make other binaries that
link to QJson fail.  Please let me know if this is not the case.

Coming improvements: as of today (Jan 9, 2012) there are versions of
all these packages built on Launchpad, but they are not properly
linked to QJson in the Launchpad build.  Yet.  I also intend to
produce RPMs and maybe BSD ports for nobdy.
